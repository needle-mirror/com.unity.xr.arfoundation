# XR Simulation project settings

Go to **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **XR Plug-in Management** > **XR Simulation** to tune the performance of XR Simulation according to your project's needs. XR Simulation project settings are saved under your Assets folder at `XR/Resources/XRSimulationRuntimeSettings.asset`.

# XR Simulation preferences

Go to menu **Edit** > **Preferences** > **XR Simulation** (Windows) or **Unity** > **Preferences** > **XR Simulation** (Mac) to set your preferences for XR Simulation. Preferences are saved under your Assets folder at `XR/UserSimulationSettings/Resources/XRSimulationPreferences.asset`.

![XR Simulation preferences](../images/simulation-preferences.png)<br/>*XR Simulation preferences*

| Setting | Description |
| :------ | :---------- |
| **Environment Prefab** | Stores the Prefab asset for the active XR Simulation environment. Note that it is easier to set this in the [XR Environment view](xref:arfoundation-simulation-xr-environment-view) because the view's Environment list only includes environment Prefabs rather than every Prefab in the project. |
| **Enable Navigation** | Enables or disables the navigation controls that XR simulation adds to the Game view (using the **WASD**, **Q**, **E**, and **Shift** keys and the mouse). You can disable these navigation controls if they interfere with your own input handling. |
