# XR Simulation project settings

Go to **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **XR Plug-in Management** > **XR Simulation** to tune the performance of XR Simulation according to your project's needs. XR Simulation project settings are saved under your Assets folder at `XR/Resources/XRSimulationRuntimeSettings.asset`.
