## Input Data Ports

| Port | Data type | Description |

| **Target** | [GameObject](xref:UnityEngine.GameObject) | Target GameObject should have an enabled [ARPointCloudManager](xref:arfoundation-point-clouds#ar-point-cloud-manager-component) component. If you do not connect this port, this node searches for an enabled AR Point Cloud Manager component in the scene instead, and throws an exception if none is found. |
