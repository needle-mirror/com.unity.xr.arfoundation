# Occlusion

Occlusion allows mixed reality content in your app to appear hidden or partially obscured behind objects in the physical environment. Without occlusion, geometry in your scene will always render on top of physical objects in the AR background, regardless of their difference in depth. The [AR Occlusion Manager](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.AROcclusionManager) component controls occlusion functionality in your app.

Refer to the following topics to understand how to use AR Foundation occlusion:
