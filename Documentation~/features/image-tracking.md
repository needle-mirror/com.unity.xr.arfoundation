# Image tracking

Understand and implement AR Foundation image tracking.

Image tracking allows your app to detect and track 2D images in the environment. The [AR Tracked Image Manager](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARTrackedImageManager) component controls image tracking functionality in your app, and creates [ARTrackedImage](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARTrackedImage) trackables for each detected image.
