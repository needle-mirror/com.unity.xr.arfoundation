| ColorSpace           | The color space information tag (ColorSpace) is always recorded as the color space specifier. Normally sRGB (=1) is used to define the color space based on the PC monitor conditions and environment. If a color space other than sRGB is used, Uncalibrated (=FFFF.H) is set. Image data recorded as Uncalibrated may be treated as sRGB when is converted to Flashpix.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| PhotographicSensitivity           | This tag indicates the sensitivity of the camera or input device when the image was shot. More specifically, it indicates one of the following values that are parameters defined in ISO 12232: standard output sensitivity (SOS), recommended exposure index (REI), or ISO speed. Accordingly, if a tag corresponding to a parameter that is designated by a SensitivityType tag is recorded, the values of the tag and of this PhotographicSensitivity tag are the same. However, if the value is 65535 (the maximum value of SHORT) or higher, the value of the tag shall be 65535. When recording this tag, the SensitivityType tag should also be recorded. In addition, while "Count = Any", only 1 count should be used when recording this tag. Note that this tag was referred to as "ISOSpeedRatings" in versions of this standard up to Version 2.21. |
| MeteringMode           | The metering mode. Default = 0. 0 = Unknown. 1 = Average. 2 = CenterWeightedAverage. 3 = Spot. 4 = MultiSpote. 5 = Pattern. 6 = Partial. 255 = Other. Other = reserved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
