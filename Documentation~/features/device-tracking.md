# Device tracking

After following the AR Foundation [scene setup](xref:arfoundation-scene-setup) instructions, your scene contains a preconfigured GameObject named "XR Origin". The XR Origin GameObject automatically handles device tracking and transforming trackables into Unity's coordinate system via its [XROrigin](xref:xr-core-utils-xr-origin-reference) component and GameObject hierarchy with a Camera and [TrackedPoseDriver](xref:UnityEngine.InputSystem.XR.TrackedPoseDriver). Refer to the following sections to understand device tracking in AR Foundation:
