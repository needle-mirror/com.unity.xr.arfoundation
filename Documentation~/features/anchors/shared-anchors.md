# Shared anchors

Some platforms implement a shared anchors API that enables you to share anchors between colocated users. The shared anchors feature enables users within the same physical space to share and load anchors to their devices. You can use this feature on supported platforms to enable local multiplayer experiences with a shared frame of reference.

## Supported platforms

Not all platforms support shared anchors, and the implementation of this feature varies between platforms. Refer to the relevant documentation for your target platform to learn about platform-specific shared anchors implementation.

The following platforms support shared anchors functionality:
