The `Environment Probes` sample demonstrates AR Foundation [Environment probes](xref:arfoundation-environment-probes) functionality. You can open this sample in Unity from the `Assets/Scenes/EnvironmentProbes` folder.

## Environment probes scene

Environment probes is a feature which attempts to generate a 3D texture from the real environment and applies it to reflection probes in the scene.

The sample scene includes several spheres which start out completely black, but will change to shiny spheres which reflect the real environment when possible.
