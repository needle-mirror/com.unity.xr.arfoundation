# AR world map sample

The `AR World Map` sample demonstrates the ARKit [ARWorldMap feature](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arworldmap) (Apple developer documentation).

The ARWorldMap feature is ARKit-specific which lets you save a scanned area. ARKit can optionally relocalize to a saved world map at a later time. You can use this feature to synchronize multiple devices to a common space, or for curated experiences specific to a location. For example, a museum exhibition or other special installation. A world map will store most types of trackables, such as reference points and planes.

## Requirements

This sample requires iOS 12 or newer.

## ARWorldMapController script

The [ARWorldMapController](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/arfoundation-samples/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/Runtime/ARWorldMapController.cs) script performs most of the logic in this sample.
