# Thermal state sample

The `Thermal State` sample contains the code required to query for an iOS device's [Thermal state](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/power_efficiency_guidelines_osx/RespondToThermalStateChanges.html) (Apple developer documentation).

You can use the code provided in this sample to use the thermal state with C# game code.

This sample illustrates how you can use the thermal state to disable AR Foundation features to reduce the thermal state of the device.
