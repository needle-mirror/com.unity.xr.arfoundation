The `SimulationCameraSubsystem` in AR Foundation 5.0 does not support the [TryAcquireLatestCpuImage](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.XRCameraSubsystem.TryAcquireLatestCpuImage(UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.XRCpuImage@)) API, and this property now correctly returns `false`. If you need access to `TryAcquireLatestCpuImage` in XR Simulation, you can upgrade to AR Foundation 5.1, currently in pre-release.\n- Fixed an issue where `SimulationCameraSubsystem.TryAcquireLatestCpuImage` incorrectly returned `true`. This API previously assigned invalid data to its out parameter, and now correctly throws a `NotSupportedException` instead. If you need access to `TryAcquireLatestCpuImage` in XR Simulation, you can upgrade to AR Foundation 5.1, currently in pre-release."
