    "changelog": "### Added\n\n- Added AR Foundation API definitions for persistent anchors. Provider plug-ins can implement these methods, which allow you to save anchors during an AR session and re-load them during subsequent sessions:\n  - [ARAnchorManager.TrySaveAnchorAsync](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARAnchorManager.TrySaveAnchorAsync(UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.TrackableId,System.Threading.CancellationToken))\n  - [ARAnchorManager.TryLoadAnchorAsync](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARAnchorManager.TryLoadAnchorAsync(UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.SerializableGuid,System.Threading.CancellationToken))\n  - [ARAnchorManager.TryEraseAnchorAsync](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARAnchorManager.TryEraseAnchorAsync(UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.SerializableGuid,System.Threading.CancellationToken))\n  - [ARAnchorManager.TryGetSavedAnchorIdsAsync](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARAnchorManager.TryGetSavedAnchorIdsAsync(Unity.Collections.Allocator,System.Threading.CancellationToken))\n- Added an implicit conversion operator between [TrackableId](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.TrackableId) and [SerializableGuid](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.SerializableGuid).\n- Added a constructor to [SerializableGuid](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.SerializableGuid) allowing the creation of `SerializableGuid`s with a `System.Guid`.\n- Added [ARAnchorManager.TryRemoveAnchor](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.TryRemoveAnchor) API for removing anchors. You can either use this new method or disable the `ARAnchor` component to remove an anchor.\n- Added XR Simulation's `SimulationCameraPoseProvider` as a public component.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Changed documentation to indicate that Meshing is now a supported feature in the Unity OpenXR: Meta provider plug-in.\n- Changed the behavior of `ARMeshManager` to recalculate normals on a mesh if normals were requested and the provider did not calculate them.\n- Changed the minimum Unity version from 2023.3 to 6000.0, reflecting the new version number of Unity 6. Refer to the official [Unity 6 New Naming Convention](https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-6-new-naming-convention.1558592/) announcement for more information.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed [issue ARFB-421](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ARFB-421) which caused `ARMeshManager` to crash the Editor in XR Simulation when its **Normals** property was not enabled.\n- Fixed [issue ARFB-380](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-elements-of-ui-toolkit-arent-displayed-when-ar-foundation-camera-facing-direction-is-set-to-user) where UI toolkit elements disappeared after one frame when running an XR scene with a user-facing camera on Android devices.\n- Fixed an issue where disabling the `AROcclusionManager` component in XR Simulation would not stop the simulation background shader from sampling the depth texture.\n- Fixed an issue where XR Simulation camera pose data could leak between multiple AR sessions.\n- Corrected a previous fix for an issue where the tvOS build target would have compile errors in `Simulation.InputLayoutLoader`."
