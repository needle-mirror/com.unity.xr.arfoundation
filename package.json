    "changelog": "### Fixed\n\n- Fixed a typo in `Feature.ToStringList`.\n- Fixed the XR Environment view so that it no longer sets the title of the Scene view to null if you launch the Editor with the XR Environment overlay open. ([ARFB-592](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/installing-ar-foundation-package-corrupts-scene-view-tab-text))\n- Fixed the XR Environment overlay so that it no longer causes \"Unable to load the Icon\" errors in the Console when AR Foundation is first installed to a project. ([ARFB-593](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unable-to-load-the-icon-errors-are-thrown-in-the-console-after-installing-ar-foundation-package))\n- Fixed an internal utility that could incorrectly cache references to destroyed subsystems, which in turn could cause bugs if you deinitialized and re-initialized the `SimulationLoader`.\n- Fixed `XRAnchor.Equals` so that it considers the anchor's `parentId` when comparing for equality.\n- Fixed an issue where disabling the AROcclusionManager could cause some objects to become incorrectly occluded for ARCore and ARKit apps.\n- Fixed `LoaderUtility` so that it correctly initializes or deinitializes the OpenXR Loader when you call `Initialize` or `Deinitialize`, respectfully.\n- Fixed the following methods of [XRBoundingBox](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.XRBoundingBox):\n  - `ToString` now lists the struct members in the order they appear in the stuct\n  - `Equals` now correctly considers a bounding box's `parentId` when comparing for equality\n  - `GetHashCode` now correctly considers a bounding box's `parentId` when generating a hash code."
