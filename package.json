    "changelog": "### Added\n\n- Added `XRMarkerSubsystemDescriptor.Cinfo` properties for `id`, `providerType`, and `subsystemTypeOverride` that are needed during subsystem registration.\n- Added [XRBoundingBoxBuilder](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.XRBoundingBoxBuilder), [BoundedPlaneBuilder](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.BoundedPlaneBuilder), and [XRMarkerBuilder](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.XRMarkerBuilder) which provide fluent APIs for constructing `XRBoundingBox`, `BoundedPlane`, and `XRMarker` instances, respectively.\n- Added `XRMarkerBuilder.WithPose` overload that takes an OpenXR `XrPosef` representing the session space pose and converts it to a Unity world space pose to build the marker with.\n- Added `InnerWallFace` semantic label to [PlaneClassifications](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.PlaneClassifications).\n- Added support for the `IEquatable<XRResultStatus>` and `IEquatable<Result<T>>` interfaces to [Result\\<T\\>](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.Result`1).\n- Added a `ToString` override to [XRResultStatus](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.XRResultStatus).\n- Added a `ToString` override to [Result\\<T\\>](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.Result`1).\n- Added an implicit conversion operator from [SerializableGuid](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.SerializableGuid) to [XrUuid](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.openxr@1.16/api/UnityEngine.XR.OpenXR.NativeTypes.XrUuid.html) if your project contains OpenXR Plug-in 1.16.0 or newer.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Changed pre-release property types `ARMarker.markerId` and `XRMarker.markerId` from `int` to `uint`.\n- Changed the type of [XRBoundingBox](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.XRBoundingBox) from `struct` to `readonly struct`.\n- Changed the pre-release methods `XRMarkerSubsystem.TryGetStringData` and `XRMarkerSubsystem.TryGetBytesData` to now take the marker's `TrackableId` as a new argument when querying for a marker's encoded data.\n\n### Deprecated\n\n- Deprecated and replaced the following properties of [XRAnchorSubsystemDescriptor.Cinfo](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.XRAnchorSubsystemDescriptor.Cinfo) to allow providers to determine at runtime whether AR Foundation persistent anchor APIs are supported::\n  - `supportsSaveAnchor` to `supportsSaveAnchorDelegate`\n  - `supportsLoadAnchor` to `supportsLoadAnchorDelegate`\n  - `supportsEraseAnchor` to `supportsEraseAnchorDelegate`\n  - `supportsGetSavedAnchorIds` to `supportsGetSavedAnchorIdsDelegate`\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed an issue with the XR Simulation provider where creating new sessions through loading new scenes would throw exceptions and fail to start those new sessions.\n- Fixed an issue where disabling the AROcclusionManager could cause some objects to become incorrectly occluded for ARCore and ARKit apps.\n- Fixed [ARRaycastManager](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARRaycastManager) so that fallback raycasts can still be invoked if the AR Raycast Manager component is created at runtime.\n- Fixed internal code so that if trackables of different types share the same `TrackableId`, their GameObjects are spawned correctly with no exceptions logged to the console. ([ARFB-665](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ARFB-665)).\n- Fixed `LoaderUtility` so that it correctly initializes or deinitializes the OpenXR Loader when you call `Initialize` or `Deinitialize`, respectfully.\n- Fixed the following methods of [XRBoundingBox](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.XRBoundingBox):\n  - `ToString` now lists the struct members in the order they appear in the stuct\n  - `Equals` now correctly considers a bounding box's `parentId` when comparing for equality\n  - `GetHashCode` now correctly considers a bounding box's `parentId` when generating a hash code.\n- Fixed pre-release `XRMarker` API documentation to indicate that its pose is in Unity world space and not in OpenXR session space.\n- Fixed `ARTrackableManager` so that it calls `OnAfterSetSessionRelativeData` for added trackables.\n- Fixed `SimulatedTrackedImage` and `SimulatedBoundingBox` so that they no longer use APIs which are deprecated in Unity 6.4 or newer."
