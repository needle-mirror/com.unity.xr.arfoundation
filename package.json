    "changelog": "### Added\n\n- Added new values to the [BoundingBoxClassifications](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.BoundingBoxClassifications) enum: `Keyboard`, `Mouse`, and `Laptop`.\n- Added constructors and `defaultValue` properties to `XRSaveAnchorResult`, `XRLoadAnchorResult`, and `XREraseAnchorResult` structs.\n- Added [ARFaceManager.TryGetBlendShapes](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARFaceManager.TryGetBlendShapes), which provides information about the facial expression of a tracked face.\n  - Added the struct `XRFaceBlendShape`, which provides information about the degree of articulation of a specific facial feature.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Changed [ARRaycastManager](xref:arfoundation-raycasts-raycastmanager) to always support physics-based ray casts as a fallback implementation, even if the provider doesn't implement the `XRRaycastSubsystem`. For more information, refer to [Fallback ray casts](xref:arfoundation-raycasts-raycastmanager#fallback-ray-casts)\n\n### Deprecated\n\n- Deprecated everything associated with URP Compatibility Mode, as URP Compatibility Mode is now hidden by default in Unity 6.3. Refer to [Render Graph Updates in Unity 6.3](https://discussions.unity.com/t/render-graph-updates-in-unity-6-3/1668122) (Unity Discussions) for more information. The following methods are deprecated:\n* `ARBackgroundRendererFeature.Execute`\n* `ARBackgroundRendererFeature.Configure`\n* `ARCommandBufferSupportRendererFeature.Execute`\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed a typo in `Feature.ToStringList`."
