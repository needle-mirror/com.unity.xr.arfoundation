    "changelog": "### Added\n\n- Added a constructor to `Result<T>` that enables more convenient construction of successful results.\n- Added a `parentId` property to `ARTrackable` with a public getter.\n- Added conversion operators between `XRResultStatus` and the new `OpenXRResultStatus` type introduced in OpenXR Plug-in 1.16.0-pre.1.\n- Added a new enum member `XRResultStatus.StatusCode.Unsupported`.\n- Added a constructor to `XRAnchor` that allows you to initialize all the struct fields.\n- Added [XRAnchorBuilder](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.XRAnchorBuilder), which provides a fluent API for constructing `XRAnchor` instances.\n- Added a constructor to `TrackableChanges<T>` that allows you construct an instance given `IEnumerable<T>` input collections.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Changed how trackable GameObjects are spawned to support parent-child hierarchies of any depth, allowing trackable GameObjects to have other trackable GameObjects as their parent.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed an internal utility that could incorrectly cache references to destroyed subsystems, which in turn could cause bugs if you deinitialized and re-initialized the `SimulationLoader`.\n- Fixed child trackable GameObjects so that their position is not adjusted when their parent is changed.\n- Fixed `XRAnchor.Equals` so that it considers the anchor's `parentId` when comparing for equality."
