    "changelog": "### Changed\n\n- Changed the behavior of `XRAnchorSubsystem` so that if you call `GetChanges` while the subsystem is stopped, it will no longer throw an `InvalidOperationException`. It is valid to call `GetChanges` while the subsystem is stopped to retrieve information about anchors that were in the middle of an asynchronous operation at the moment when the subsystem was stopped.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed `XRFaceSubsystem` so that it no longer creates duplicate profiler markers for its `GetChanges` implementation.\n- Fixed the `ARAnchor` component so that if it fails to add itself as an anchor with the anchor subsystem, the component disables itself instead of deactivating its GameObject.\n- Fixed `SimulationImageTrackingSubsystem` behavior to not throw an exception when stopping and restarting the subsystem through the enabling and disabling of the `ARTrackedImageManager` ([ARFB-554](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ARFB-554)).\n- Fixed the XR Simulation native plugins so that they no longer throw `DllNotFoundException` on Windows ARM64 systems."
