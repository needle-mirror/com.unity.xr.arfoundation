    "changelog": "### Fixed\n\n- Fixed the `SimulationRaycastSubsystem` to correctly state via `XRRaycastSubsystemDescriptor.supportedTrackableTypes` that casting rays against planes is supported in XR Simulation.\n- Fixed the `SimulationSessionSubsystem` so it doesn't log an error if you call `ARSession.Reset` before the session is initialized.\n- Fixed the XR Simulation point clouds implementation so that it no longer logs an error when the AR Point Cloud Manager component is disabled and then re-enabled. ([ARFB-487](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ARFB-487))\n- Fixed the `SimulationEnvironmentProbeSubsystem` so that [automatic placement](xref:arfoundation-environment-probes#automatic-placement) of environment probes can be enabled or disabled, as is possible on other AR platforms.\n- Fixed the AR Environment Probe Manager component so that it can no longer throw an `ArgumentNullException` when you unload a scene containing one or more environment probes.\n- Fixed the AR Environment Probe Manager component so that it can no longer throw an `InvalidOperationException` when you unload a scene containing one or more environment probes. ([ARFB-521](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ARFB-521))\n- Fixed `XRFaceSubsystem` so that it no longer creates duplicate profiler markers for its `GetChanges` implementation."
